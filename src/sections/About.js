      By trade I am a software engineer with 4+ years of experience working in the real-estate and financial industries. I have experience working with both small and large teams to deliver on both technically-challenging and product-oriented projects. I enjoy working cross-functionally and thrive in environments where I can learn a lot, take on responsibility, and collaborate with others. I am currently looking for roles in product, operations, or strategy.
