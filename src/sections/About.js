      I am a full-stack software engineer with four years of professional experience working in the real-estate and financial sectors. I am looking to join a small team in an industry that I am interested in and where I will be able to write a lot of code and be able to contribute to product decisions.

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p className={'subheading'}>
      I love to read, travel, cook, listen to music, walk around and think, engage in physical activity, and surround myself with people I love. I'm trying to learn how to embarrass myself and have many spectacular failures, so if you know how to do that, you should hit me up. I live in New York City, and it's proving to be one of my favorite cities in the world. My favorite hobby is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Currently I am a blue belt at Renzo Gracie UWS Academy.

      My ultimate goal is to be an entrepreneur and help empower people through art, science, and technology. I have had many hilariously awful attempts to start a business, which you should ask me about.
