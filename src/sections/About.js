          <p className={'subheading'}>
            I am a software engineer with two years of experience working in the real-estate technology.
            My experience working both at a fast-paced startup and at a large company have helped shape the way I write and deliver software.
            I understand how to balance between the needs of shipping code fast and maintaining quality, readability, and scalability. I genuinely love writing code and firmly believe in its ability to solve problems and move our society forward. My ultimate goal is to be an entrepreneur and create products that help people in any sort of capacity.
            <br /><br />
            Outside of work, I love to read, travel, hang out in caf√©s, and do anything physical, including weight-lifting, running, and learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
